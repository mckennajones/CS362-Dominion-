Using gcov, the coverage for the 8 unit tests which I implemented was 19.89%.
This value is not very high. However, the unit tests which I implemented were
for some of the smaller functions in dominion.c. That being said, the percentage
shows that if we want to be sure that the program is bug free, we need more unit
tests. We also need tests that cover more of the code. Looking at the output of
gcov, for some of the functions which were tested, not all scenarios were covered.
If a unit test is supposedly testing a function, we want it to cover the entire function.
